            CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system created specifically to
            tackle grid-based user interfaces on the web.

               <p>
            Grids are fundamental to the design of layouts. Over the Web&#8217;s relatively
            short life-span, developers have been trying all kinds of methods and hacks for laying
            out content in the browser. We started off with no way to do page layout, to table-based
            layouts, followed by float-based layouts. But those approaches were, at best, workarounds,
            because neither tables nor floats were meant to be used as true layout tools.

            Enter CSS Grid. The Grid
            Layout Working Draft was published back in April 2011. Three of the four authors were from
            Microsoft and the first IE10 Platform Preview <code>-ms</code>
            prefixed Grid implementation. Over the course of 6 years, the specification has evolved based
            on feedback from developers and browser vendors working together to come up with a truly effective
            native CSS grid solution.

            CSS Grid introduces a series of properties that allow us to create grid structures and control
            the placement and sizing of grid items using CSS. This means that we are able to use
            to adapt our grids to different contexts. We can rearrange the layout of grid items independent
            of their source order, which allows us to shift grid items around to cater for these varying
            contexts without having to change the underlying markup.
